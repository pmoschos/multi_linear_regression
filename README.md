<a name="overview"></a>
## 🔍 Overview
This Python script demonstrates the creation of a multi-linear regression model using the `scikit-learn` library. It's designed to predict housing prices based on factors like average area income, house age, number of rooms and bedrooms, and area population. The script includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the model for future predictions.
